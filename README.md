# Elevator-Controller-BASYS
A simple elevator controller demo in Verilog for a Basys3 board.
Created in Vivado for the Basys3 constraints.

Implements a Finite State Machine for controlling its next step based on the floors to visit and its current location. 
The elevator maintains a prefered direction so that it does not jump around the place. 
Handles multiple inputs at the same time.
